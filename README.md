# apex-skin-test

Testing ground for developing a stream overlay for playing minigames in APEX Legends. Requires seeing player skins so using public-api.tracker.gg/apex for information.

⚠️ It seems that accessing the API doesn't work (getting `Invalid authentication credentials`). That's why I'm applying for production use.
